# Master Thesis - Selection and Analysis of tools used for automating deployment processes

This is repo that contains simple DevOps project for the purpose of writing my masther thesis.

For the test Spring PetClinic Sample Application (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) was used. Big thanks for that! 

Being honest, a lot of mistakes and simplifications have been made in this thesis or project itself. A lot of good practices were skipped or not followed. 

Nevertheless, it was a nice adventure and remember that the only person who doesn't make mistakes is the person who never tries new things. :)
